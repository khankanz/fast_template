# Thinking Through BI-RADS Classification: My Journey with NLP and Radiology Reports

## The Problem I'm Tackling

Okay, so here's what I'm dealing with: I've got these radiology reports, and I need to find and classify BI-RADS scores. Sounds simple, right? Well, not quite.

Here's the deal:
- These reports can mention BI-RADS (or BIRADS, because why make it easy?) multiple times.
- The scores range from 0 to 6, with some funky 4a, 4b, 4c thrown in for good measure.
- Oh, and my training data? It's missing some labels. Because of course it is.

## My First Attempt: Bigger is Better, Right?

So, my first thought was, "Hey, let's just make the model bigger!" I went from a 345M parameter model to a whopping 3.9B. Guess what? It didn't help much. 

This got me thinking:
1. Is my data the problem?
2. Is this task too specific for general language model improvements?
3. Am I just overfitting on a grand scale?

## New Plan: Break It Down

Alright, let's not panic. I've got a new idea: split this beast into two tasks.

### Task 1: Find the Needle in the Haystack

First up, let's just count how many times BI-RADS shows up. Simple, right?

What I'm hoping to learn:
- Can my model find all the mentions?
- Is it seeing things that aren't there?
- How does it compare to a basic keyword search?

### Task 2: What's the Score?

Once we find BI-RADS, let's see if we can figure out what score it's talking about.

The goal:
- Match each BI-RADS mention to the right category (0-4, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5, 6)
- See where the model gets confused

## Things to Keep in Mind

1. I need to look closely at where things go wrong. Is it the data? The model? The task itself?
2. What's the spread of different BI-RADS categories in my data? This could be skewing things.
3. Maybe play around with how much text around "BI-RADS" I feed into the model.
4. Those missing categories (4b, 4c) could be throwing a wrench in the works.
5. It might be helpful to know when the model is unsure. Could save some headaches later.

## Where to Go From Here

I've got some ideas:
- Maybe I need more data, or better data.
- Could try using a model that's already trained on medical stuff.
- Might need to hard-code some rules about how BI-RADS works.
- What if I trained on other radiology tasks too?
- Could set up a system where humans check the tricky cases.

## Wrapping Up

So, that's where I'm at. Increasing the model size didn't magically solve everything (shocker). But breaking down the problem might help me figure out where things are going sideways.

The key seems to be getting better data rather than just throwing more parameters at the problem. Time to roll up my sleeves and dig into the nitty-gritty of BI-RADS classification!
